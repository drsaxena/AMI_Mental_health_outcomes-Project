This is the complete code for the project: Sex Differences in Onset of New Cognitive or Psychological Events Following Acute Coronary Syndrome in Older Adults
Abstract
Background: Anxiety, depression, and cognitive changes are common adverse outcomes following acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These challenges also predict an increased risk of adverse cardiac outcomes. While it is known that females have higher rates of psychological symptoms generally, data on sex differences in onset following an acute cardiac event are scarce, especially among older adults.
  
Goals/Aims: Our goal was to determine if sex differences exist in mental health and cognitive outcomes after acute coronary syndrome in older adults. 
 
Hypothesis: Females are more likely to have new psychological and cognitive issues within one year of ACS compared to male patients. 
 
Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using Texas Medicare claims data from 2017-2020. The study population consisted of those 65 and older, diagnosed with ACS (either STEMI or NSTEMI). Eligible participants had continuous enrollment in Medicare Part A and B for at least one year before and after the index event, were not part of any Health Maintenance Organization and had no prior diagnosis of the outcomes of interest (anxiety, depression, amnesia , and dementia). Data were extracted on demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and intervention type (i.e. PCI/CABG). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and survival analyses were conducted to study the outcomes.  
 
Results: Our study included 41,420 patients (17,568, 42.4% females), 9,992 with STEMI and 31,428 with NSTEMI. In STEMI and NSTEMI patients respectively, the prevalence of the onset of outcomes were significantly higher among females compared to males: anxiety (15.3% vs 9.1%; 16.8% vs 11.4%), depression (11.2% vs 7.8%; 13.8% vs 9.8%); dementia (7.6% vs 5.4%; 11.0% vs 8.5%). In multivariate models differences in onset of anxiety and depression were seen both by sex and by treatment type. In the survival models, females had statistically higher risk of developing anxiety (HR:1.7, 95% CI: 1.6-1.9) and depression (HR:1.6, 95% CI:1.4-1.7) as did those who went underwent CABG as compared to PCI (Anxiety-HR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3,1.6), Depression- HR: 1.4, 96% CI: 1.3, 1.6).
 
Conclusion: Significant sex differences exist in cognitive and mental health outcomes after ACS. Females are more likely to have worse outcomes following ACS as compared to males. Additionally, across sexes, psychological outcomes are worse following CABG as compared to PCI.
